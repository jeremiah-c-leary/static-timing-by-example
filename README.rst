Overview
--------

This effort is a methodology documentation for static timing analysis (STA).
It is an attempt to explain in detail how to:

* Understand the equations for STA
* Write timing constraints
* Validate timing constraints

I also plan on providing TCL constraint files which can be used for forming STA.
